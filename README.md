Lottery in Visual Basic

I developed in Visual Basic
Project in group of 3 people
The objective is to make a program of a simulation of a lottery
The program had a code generator
The lottery program when going up you could play maximum 5 dollars and by giving it play the program started running and 
also had an exit and an about that the version told you a description and those who developed the program.
